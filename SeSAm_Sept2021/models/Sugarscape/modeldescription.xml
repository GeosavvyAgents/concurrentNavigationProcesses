    This model implements parts of the first chapter of the famous book "Growing Artificial Societies" by 
    Epstein/Axtell. Agents (red circles) possess local perception and head for the highest sugar storages 
    in their environment. In the classical configuration there are two sugar-hills with high sugar 
    production (yellow).
