An agent of that group     then will take the call and answer it    as soon as possible. Of course it might happen that people dial the wrong number     (e.g. sales instead    of technical support) or that an employee is unable to answer all questions of the     customer (if its skill level is too low for the degree of difficulty). In both     cases the call is forwarded to another agent if possible.     </Description> </Model>
