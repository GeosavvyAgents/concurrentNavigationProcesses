    <Description>This is a small predator ("Jaeger") - prey ("Beute") model in German that was developed as a play ground for school students. Predators perform a random walk until they perceive a prey that is pursued until it is killed or until it vanishes in a hole. Preys also perform a random walk. When they perceive  a predator they search for the next hole and try to reach it.</Description>
