	<Description> This model shows a monitoring scenario based on emergent information propagation: 
1) Targets move from one side towards the opposite side 
2) MovableAgents (Hunters -displayed as black squares) try to catch them. 
 The sensor range of MovableAgents is limited to a small area around them. 
	
3) To improve the process of catching agents, a third type of agent 
 (StationaryAgent, displayed as a lighthouse) is placed on fixed locations 
 in the world. They create information objects whenever a target appears in 
 their sensor range to lead MovableAgents to the target. 
	
4) These information objects are called "pheromones" according to the biological 
 inspired implicit communication used in the model. They are drawn as blue 
 circles (with darker color depending on the strength of the "pheromone").</Description>
