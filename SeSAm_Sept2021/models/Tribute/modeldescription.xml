    <Description>
This model is a re-implementation of the famous Tribute model of R. Axelrod.
("Emergence of New Political Actors"). Agents are positioned in ring. One 
agent is activated. This agent may decide to demand tribute from one of its 
neighbours according to some vulnerablity. The attacked agents decides 
whether to fight or to pay due to the potential costs of war or tribute. 
Costs, vulnerability, tribute are computed based on the wealth of an agent. 
Paying tribute changes some commitment structure that again influences who 
might demand tribute from whom.
After three activations, wealth of all agents is increased.
