    <Description>
    This model shows people waiting in a queue to be served, for example at a post office or at the check-in counters in an airport. The blue circles represent the counter clerks behind their black desks. Waiting agents are represented as circles, too. They get a random colour out of a colour-list to clarify the movements of the queue.
