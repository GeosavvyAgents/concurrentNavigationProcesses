	<Description> This model is not a real MultiAgent Simulation, but it shows very imposingly how the simple behaviour of several single items may result in a system respecing all game rules. Your aim is to collect gems from the board. You may pick them up if there are at least three equal gems in a row or a column. In addition you are allowed to exchange gems at adjacent board positions, if you can collect some gems afterward.
