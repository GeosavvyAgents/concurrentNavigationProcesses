<Description> This model was the first prototype for a simulation of a highrack 
storage. Boxes and racks and conveyers are realized as agents and 
ressources. The aim was to create a virtual storage house for the 
following purposes:

1) Testing a new storage control software.
2) Presenting storage layouts.
3) Introducing the software at the customers site.
