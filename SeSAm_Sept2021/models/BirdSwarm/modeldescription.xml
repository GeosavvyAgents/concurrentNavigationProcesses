The simulation is based on behavoiour rules, invented by Craig Reynolds. Every bird agent has three goals:1) He wants to move into the same direction as the boids surrounding him2) He wants to be in the middle of the boids surrounding him3) He wants to keep a certain distance from the boids surrounding him.These three simple rules are enough to produce flocking behaviour.</Description></Model>
