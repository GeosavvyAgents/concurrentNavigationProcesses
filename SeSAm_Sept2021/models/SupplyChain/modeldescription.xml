    <Description>
	The supply chain in the little example model consists of five steps û all indicated by products (i.e.
	circles) in another colour. The last step represents a consumer agent, who just has to order the
	desired products from the previous agents and dose not have to produce anything by itself. Trading
	relationships between two agents are represented by a black line like depicted in the picture.

	An agent is building products for an order or for its own storeroom, unless there is no order and the
	maximum capacity of its storeroom is reached. In this case there is no work to be done and the
	agent pauses. Of course the production of a product needs some time.
	If an agent wants to produce a product, but hasn't got enough raw materials, it has to order the
	missing materials from an agent of the previous production step. Therefore it chooses the agent with
	the highest amount of finished pieces or, if there is more than one agent with the same amount, it
	chooses one of these agents randomly. Thereby products produced for another order are not taken
	into account. If the supplier has produced the proper amount of ordered products, it delivers the
	products to its client. For each product an agent has to produce it can choose another supplier. So
	trade relations might change often. To refine this process of choosing a supplier one could also take
	other aspects into account (which then can be analysed with the help of suitable analyses).
