SeSAm (Shell for Simulated Agent Systems) provides a generic environment 
for modeling and experimenting with agent-based simulation. 

We specially focused on providing a tool for the easy construction of 
complex models, which include dynamic interdependencies or emergent 
behavior.

Since 2008, it is developed and maintained by the 
Interactive Simulation Group at MRSC/Orebro University, Sweden.
