# concurrent Navigation Processes

This repository contains the code needed to run an agent-based model of concurrent human navigation processes described in the paper "Realistic Agent Behaviour based on Concurrent Process Architectures â€“ Modelling Human Navigation" published and presented by Sabine Timpf and Franziska Klugl at the EUMAS 2025 conference https://euramas.github.io/eumas2025/.

If you want to run the code, you will have to install Java 1.8 on your machine, download the repository, start SeSAm.jar and then load the model file called campus_objectGraph_vXX.xml, where XX is a number (as of Jul 2025, this number is 94).
More information will be added after the conference.
